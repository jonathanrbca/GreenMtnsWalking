    <p>It all began with an impulsive decision. Towards the end of one of the early COVID waves, and after I had sheltered in place for several months, my twenty-year-old-plus Honda Civic wouldn't start. Well, the heck with it! Who needs a car anyway?</p>
    <p>When it came time to go back to in-person work, I stubbornly clung to that decision. I sold the Honda to a co-worker, he plunked in a new battery, and off it went, good as ever.</p>
    <p>To go carless, in LA County, when you don't have to, is an eccentric life-style choice, to say the least. There's the Metro, there's bumming rides from friends and colleagues, there's Lyft and Uber. There's breaking down and renting a car for a day or two. There are also bicycling, skateboarding, rollerblading -- not that I have tried any of those yet.</p>
    <p>And then there's walking. If you can simplify your life enough (if!), much can be said for walking as a mode of transportation. I've stretched it out to one, two, three, four hours. On these walks, the Palos Verdes Penninsula -- according to geologists a baby mountain, still going up -- is often my companion. To my East, to my South, to my West, it walks with me, marking my progress. <q class="dogen">Green mountains are walking!</q>, says Zen master Dōgen. One way to understand that!</p>
